Encrypt and decrypt PNG image files using these two respective programs.

Encryption scrambles the pixels of the original image to make it unrecognizable, and decryption unscrambles the pixels to produce the original image.

After each encryption, a 7 or 8 digit decryption code is generated. The correct code must be entered into the decryption program in order for the image to be decrypted recognizably. 

Encryption takes around 10-12 seconds, while decryption takes 20-30 minutes.
